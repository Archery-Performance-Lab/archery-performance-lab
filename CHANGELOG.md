# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows the principles of **Keep a Changelog** and the project adopts **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- ACE Physics Engine: `force()`, `calculateWeightForce()`, uniform motion helpers (`distanceFromVelocityAndTime`, `timeFromDistanceAndVelocity`, `averageVelocity`), `dragForce()`, `dragDecelerationConstant()`, `storedElasticEnergy()`.
- ACE Calculation Engines: Front of Center (`calculateFrontOfCenter`), Kinetic Energy (`calculateArrowKineticEnergy`), Momentum (`calculateArrowMomentum`), Arrow Speed estimation (`estimateArrowSpeed`), Time of Flight under drag (`calculateTimeOfFlight`), Plunger spring tension tuning (`calculateRecommendedPlungerSpringTension`) — the practical correction for dynamic spine / archer's paradox.
- `ballistics` module: full 2D trajectory under gravity and drag, integrated with a 4th-order Runge-Kutta method (`stepTrajectoryRK4`, `calculateBallisticTrajectory`).
- Static Spine data model (`StaticSpineMeasurement`), explicitly recording the test standard (`ASTM-F2031` or `AMO-ATA`) alongside the deflection value, since the two give different readings for the same shaft.
- `Plunger` (button) domain model, wired into `Bow`.
- First real implementation of the `validations` module: `isValidStaticSpineMeasurement()`.

### Changed

- `Arrow.spine: number` replaced with `Arrow.staticSpine: StaticSpineMeasurement`, to keep the measurement standard and units explicit rather than a bare number.

### Fixed

- ACE package failed to build: wrong relative path in `tsconfig.json`'s `extends`, a stale `./calculatics` import (folder had been renamed to `./calculations`), a duplicate `GRAVITY` export causing an ambiguous-export error, empty `physics` stub modules (`drag.ts`, `force.ts`, `motion.ts`) breaking `export *`, and `constants/air.ts` re-exporting itself instead of defining `AIR_DENSITY`.

## Versioning Policy

APL uses **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**.

Version numbers follow the format:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Where:

- **MAJOR**: incompatible changes.
- **MINOR**: new functionality while maintaining compatibility.
- **PATCH**: bug fixes and documentation improvements.

Example:

- 0.1.0 → Repository Foundation
- 0.2.0 → Manifesto
- 0.3.0 → Domain Model
- 1.0.0 → First Stable Release
