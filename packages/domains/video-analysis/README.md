# @apl/video-analysis

Video Analysis Engine — corresponds to **M06 Video Analysis** in
`docs/architecture/APL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Status

Domain types, one pure calculation (`calculatePhaseDurations`), and a
pose-estimation wrapper (`createPoseDetector`, `estimatePoseFrame`)
exist. Video-to-frame extraction (e.g. via ffmpeg) and shooting-phase
detection from pose data are **not** implemented yet.

The pose-estimation wrapper is type-checked and written against the
real `@tensorflow-models/pose-detection` API (its `.d.ts` files were
read directly, not guessed from memory). It runs on TensorFlow.js's
**WASM backend** (`@tensorflow/tfjs` + `@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm`),
not the more common `@tensorflow/tfjs-node` native bindings — that
package's native "tensorflow" backend does not implement several
image-preprocessing kernels BlazePose needs (`Transform`,
`RotateWithOffset`, `FlipLeftRight`), a long-standing, unresolved gap
confirmed via multiple upstream GitHub issues, not something fixable
from this package. The WASM backend implements the full kernel set and
has no compiled native addon, so it also isn't tied to the OS/CPU
architecture of the machine that ran `pnpm install`.

No `setWasmPaths()` configuration is needed: `@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm`'s
npm `"main"` entry is a Node-specific build that detects it's running
under Node and resolves its `.wasm` binary relative to its own
`__dirname` — confirmed by reading that bundle's source, and confirmed
working (backend initializes cleanly) in this project's Linux dev
sandbox, which — unlike the old native-binary approach — the
architecture-portable WASM binary can actually run in.

Backend initialization has been verified end-to-end. Full detector
creation has not, since it needs to download BlazePose's model weights
from `tfhub.dev` on first use, and that host isn't reachable from this
dev sandbox. Run the real verification yourself:

```
cd packages/domains/video-analysis
node scripts/verify-pose-detector.cjs
```

This sets the WASM backend, creates a real BlazePose detector, runs it
on a synthetic image, and confirms the pipeline doesn't crash (not
that detection is accurate — the synthetic image has no real person in
it). It needs network access the first time, since model weights are
downloaded on demand. It's a manual script, not part of `pnpm test`,
since it's slow and network-dependent — see the comment at the top of
the script.

## Next steps

- Frame extraction from video files (needs a decision: ffmpeg via a
  wrapper library, or something else).
- Wiring `estimatePoseFrame()` output into shooting-phase detection —
  this is where the `ShootingPhase` taxonomy in `types/phase.ts`
  actually gets used, so it's worth settling that taxonomy first.

## Domain model

- `types/pose.ts` — `PoseKeypoint`, `PoseFrame`. `PoseKeypoint.name` is
  a plain string, not a fixed union. In practice, BlazePose's `tfjs`
  runtime always sets a name from its fixed 33-landmark list (verified
  by reading its detector source), but the underlying library types
  the field as optional since it's shared across models, so
  `estimatePoseFrame()` falls back to a positional placeholder if it's
  ever missing rather than throwing.
- `types/phase.ts` — `ShootingPhase`, a first-pass six-phase taxonomy
  (Stance, Nocking, Drawing, Anchor, Release, FollowThrough). This is
  a starting point for discussion, not a settled decision — it should
  be reviewed against real coaching methodology before it drives any
  phase-detection logic.
- `types/shot-sequence.ts` — `ShotSequenceAnalysis`, the full result
  for one shot's video.
- `calculations/timing` — `calculatePhaseDurations()`, pure
  post-processing over already-detected phase segments.
- `pose-estimation/` — `createPoseDetector()` (BlazePose, `tfjs`
  runtime), `estimatePoseFrame()` (runs the detector on one already
  decoded frame and converts the result to `PoseFrame`).
